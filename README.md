# amverseasbinfileutilsc-
A c++ library that contains classes to work wih XBT bin files generated by Amverseas
The libray can encode and decode message types 1, 2, 3 and 4.
A type 4 message is essentially a type 3 message that stores resistace values instead of temperature values.
Storing actual raw data instead of the temperature values is useful for converting data between the different fall rate equations and applying resistance offsets when calibrating hardware configurations.
Type 4 messages are intended to be used during the calibration stage of a setup.
